# 16-bit-single-clock-cycle-MIPS-processor-


This project focuses on designing a 16-bit Single Cycle MIPS Processor using Verilog, a hardware description language. The processor executes each instruction within a single clock cycle, ensuring fast and efficient performance. It supports essential MIPS instructions for arithmetic, logic, memory access, and control flow operations. Key components include the program counter, instruction memory, ALU, register file, control unit, and data memoryâ€”all integrated into a unified datapath. The design is thoroughly tested for correctness and performance using simulation tools. The outcome is a functional, Verilogbased processor core suitable for educational use and as a foundational element in custom digital system designs.
